It's not just an issue because it's a release of a periodical; it's also an
issue in the sense that it's a problem that pervades...well, not much of
society. The issue? Bridging the gap between computational and olympiad math.
</p>

<p>
Contest math is infamously difficult; the handful of insane students make it
nigh impossible to get anywhere, it seems to the untrained eye. You'll be
surprised how far dedication gets you, though, given the abundance of online
resources. Provided the great demand for such materials, you can find much of
it for free.
</p>

<p>
The flavor changes, however, once you get to olympiad math. The math that those
insane students excel at, olympiad math is built on proofs. No longer can
you guess the answer correctly; now only an objectively correct solution can
pass. And, for those aiming to use math as a base for other endeavors (me),
olympiad math is a key step in the journey.
</p>

<p>
As AoPS is to the vast majority of math contestants, OTIS is to these elite
olympiad students. It has the necessary and sufficient material, is widely
accessible thanks to its generous scholarship policies, and is the sole source
of olympiad preparation for most.
</p>

<p>
Between these two mountains, I'm stuck in the valley. The next step in my math
journey is that into the door of olympiad math. OTIS should do the trick, or so
you should think: given the novelty of olympiad math to me, I take more time
and more effort to do what more seasoned contestants breeze through. This is
normal, but with computational math I could fine-tune the level of problems to
fit my liking; the vastness of resources let me do so. It's not the same with
olympiad math. There are fewer contests and problem collections, and even fewer
support resources.
</p>

<p>
Let me take a moment to elaborate on OTIS, for those who may be new to it. It's
a self-paced course, divided into "units." You recieve a unit after completing
the previous, but are given full freedom over the order and choice of units to
complete. Each unit typically has multiple versions and multiple difficulty
levels. Needless to say, I always opt for the lowest.
</p>

<p>
The time structure is significantly different, though, compared to prior math.
In computational math, you could expect to have a difficult problem solved in a
half hour, with easier ones being closer to two minutes. Beyond an hour, a
computational problem is considered too difficult. In olympiad math, though,
you're expected to spend about an hour and a half per problem in contest. If
you prepare with problems of the same difficulty, to do 10 problems you need a
weekend's worth of work.
</p>

<p>
Olympiad's flavor, unique in contest math, lends itself to a solution of a
different flavor. Teamwork has proven itself to be wildly effective. Whereas
you can't really get better at calculations with a team, you <em>can</em> get
better at mathematical creativity.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the past, where the emphasis is on execution of ideas, oly focuses on
generation of ideas. By the time you get to oly math, execution skills are
quite developed. Further fine-tuning isn't necessary or tested. However, the
creative leap is massive, and this is exactly what teamwork can build among
peers.
