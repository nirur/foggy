</header>

We aim to provide an affordable and sustainable water supply for those in water-scarce regions. Concretely, our design goals are:
<ul>
    <li>
        Be as cheap as possible. As a baseline, we must be cheaper than bottled water in the long-term.
    </li>
    <li>
        Be able to sell to (nearly) any willing customer. This includes small-scale portable units, units for family use, and large units for cities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Be long-lasting: customers shouldn't need to replace these units for at least a month, ideally longer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Be low-maintenance. During regular use, besides collecting water, the customer shouldn't need to interact with the system. Maintenance should be necessary at most once a month.
    </li>
</ul>
